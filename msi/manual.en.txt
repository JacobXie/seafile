Welcome to use HorizonBase client.

HorizonBase client is used to download a "library" from a HorizonBase website, which is
different from other file sync service like dropbox.

1. Create a library on HorizonBase website;

2. Download the library from HorizonBase website;

3. Files added to this donwloaded library will automatically appear on HorizonBase website.

Don't add files to the "HorizonBase" folder. That would not make it appear on the website.
